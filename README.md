## Project goals
The goal is to build an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

## Possible extensions
If you’d like to extend your project past basic requirements, here are a few ideas:

1. Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
2. Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
3. Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.
4. Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. This might be pretty difficult! You’ll essentially be creating a version of a maze solver.
